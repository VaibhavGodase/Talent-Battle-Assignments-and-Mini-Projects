🍂 Scenario: Car Parking in a Mall


❄️ . Car Parking Ticket (JWT): This is a ticket given to the car owner when they park their car. It contains information like the car number, parking spot, and time of entry.

❄️ 2. Mall's Secret Stamp (Secret Key): The parking ticket has a special stamp that only the parking office can put on it. This stamp ensures the ticket is genuine and hasn't been forged.

❄️ 3. Parking Attendant (Verifier): The person at the exit gate who checks the parking ticket to ensure it's valid before allowing the car to leave.




🍂 How It Works

❄️ 1. Issuing the Parking Ticket (Creating the JWT)

When a car enters the mall parking:

- The parking office (server) issues a ticket (JWT) with details about the car and parking spot.
- The ticket is stamped with a secret stamp (signature created using the secret key).

Example of the Ticket Issuance Process:
- Information on the Ticket (Payload): Car number, parking spot, time of entry.
- Ticket Format (Header): Information about the type of ticket and how it’s stamped.
- Special Stamp (Signature): Created using the secret key to ensure authenticity.


❄️ 2. Checking the Parking Ticket (Verifying the JWT)

When the car owner wants to leave the parking:

- The parking attendant (verifier) checks the ticket.
- The attendant verifies the special stamp using the secret stamp that only they know (the secret key).
- If the stamp is valid, the car is allowed to leave. If not, the ticket is rejected.

Example of the Ticket Verification Process:
- The car owner presents the ticket at the exit.
- The parking attendant verifies the stamp using the secret key.


🍂Why the Secret Stamp (Secret Key) is Important

❄️1. Authenticity: The secret stamp ensures that only the mall's parking office can issue valid tickets. Without the secret stamp, anyone could forge a ticket.
❄️2. Integrity: The secret stamp guarantees that the ticket has not been tampered with. If someone tries to alter the ticket details, the stamp will no longer match.

 🍂Key Points

❄️1. Parking Ticket (JWT): Contains information about the car and parking spot.
❄️2. Secret Stamp (Signature): Ensures the ticket is genuine. Created using the secret key.
❄️3. Parking Attendant (Verifier): Checks the ticket's validity using the secret key.

🍂Summary

- JWT: A token (parking ticket) containing information.
- Secret Key: A secret known only to the server (mall parking office) used to create a unique signature (stamp).
- Signature: Ensures the token (ticket) is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.
- Verification: The server (parking attendant) checks the signature using the secret key to validate the token (ticket).

By using this analogy, it becomes clear that the secret key is essential for creating a trustworthy system where only valid tickets (JWTs) are accepted, ensuring security and authenticity.
