    <h1>What is a full-stack developer?</h1>
    <p>A full-stack developer is a programmer who works within software development and is knowledgeable in both the front end and back end of an application. They work to create a seamless user experience through their diverse skill set. They're also well-versed in databases, server configuration and user interface.
        </p>
    <h3>What is a front-end developer?</h3>
    <p>“Front end” refers to what users see when they open a browser or application. In other words, the front end deals with the user interface. When you interact with a website, you’re using the front end.</p>
    <h3>What is a back-end developer?</h3>
    <p>“Back end” refers to the part of a site or application that users don't see. Back-end developers write code that creates communication between the database and the browser to ensure the site is working properly. Other back-end components include automated testing frameworks, cybersecurity, server configuration and network scalability.</p>
